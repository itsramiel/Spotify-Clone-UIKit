# Spotify Cline App with UIKit

As part of my learning of iOS development, I followed iOS Academy's [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzngncpZLuw&t=42984s) to build this app.
It helped me put theory into practice, and here are some highlights:
- I learned how to use UICollectionView and its compositional layout to create multiple scrolling sections
- While not taught in the video, I praticed using UIStackView to simplify layout out views
- Authentication
- Created too many custom cells that I am comfortable with the concept now
- Use 3rd party library, SDWebImage, to cache images
